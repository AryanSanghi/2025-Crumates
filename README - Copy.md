## Structure
The robot code follows an [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) structure (emphasizing has-a over is-a relationships). 

The `RobotTeleopMecanumDrive.java` is the primary class that holds the objects related to teleop. Currently, it contains a `Mecanum`, `Drawer`, `Elevator`, and `SpecimanArm`.

## Best Practices
- Try to follow a composition over inheritance structure when implementing new classes.
- Follow good naming practices (perferably via a style guide)
- For anything that needs to move based on input, create a method `.update(Gamepad gamepad)` and put your movement code there.
- It's a good idea to have either a `toString()` or some other method of telemetry to help debug your classes.
- Reading up on FTC documentation and doing your own research is the best way to learn.

## Miscellaneous
## Vector2
### Definition
The `Vector2` class represents a vector in 2D space with a magnitude a direction. It has a variety of methods such as `Vector2.isUnitVector()`, `Vector2.getMagnitude()`, and `Vector2.normalize()`.
### Rationale
The point of this class is to generalize inputs into a vector. By doing this, it is easy to use for both teleop and autonomous.
